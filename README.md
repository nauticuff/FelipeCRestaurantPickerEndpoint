Restaurant Picker - Endpoint
CODE: This program picks a random restaurant based on the category chosen
Reviewed by Daniel Decoito: The api and code work really well. I liked that you used routes to get the other catagories kudos.

Instructions: Run the debug on the code. 
In Postman open a new request window. 
Type in https://localhost:7186/ *This is the port number you obtained after you debugged the C# program. It is found in the debug console. Yours may differ.* 
Then type in category/ *This is the name of the controller to target*
Then type in your category: asian, italian, or mexican
It should all look similar to this https://localhost:7186/category/{asian or italian or mexican}
